# FoodLoop — Feature Spec

## Elevator Pitch

**"Turning Excess Into Impact"**

FoodLoop is a real-time food rescue platform connecting surplus food from donors (restaurants, hotels, households, caterers) to verified NGOs — before it spoils, and before someone goes hungry.

1/3 of all food produced globally is wasted. 800M+ people are food insecure. The gap isn't supply — **it's coordination.** FoodLoop is the coordination layer.

**SDG Primary:** SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) + SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production)
**SDG Secondary:** SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 17 (Partnerships)

**Judging Criteria Map:**
| Criterion | How FoodLoop wins it |
|---|---|
| UI/UX | Bespoke white+blue aesthetic, buttery UX, onboarding flows |
| Core Functionality | Realtime listings, smart matching, scheduling, QR pickup verification |
| Deployability | Expo EAS build, Express on Railway/Render, Supabase free tier — all live |
| Theme Relevance | Dual SDG impact, every feature mapped to real-world outcome |
| Pitch | Gut-punch stat → live demo → FoodPrint impact score |
| Innovation | AI Smart Match engine, FoodPrint™ metric, QR verification loop |

## Tech Stack

```
Mobile App       React Native + Expo (managed workflow, Expo Router)
Backend API      Node.js + Express (deployed on Railway or Render free tier)
Database         Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
State Mgmt       Zustand
Maps             react-native-maps + OpenStreetMap tiles (Nominatim geocoding)
Notifications    Expo Push Notifications (via backend)
Fonts            Inter (Google Fonts via expo-font)
Icons            @expo/vector-icons
Image Upload     Supabase Storage (direct from app)
QR Code          expo-barcode-scanner + react-native-qrcode-svg
```

**Architecture Flow:**
```
App  ──►  Express API  ──►  Supabase DB
           │                    │
           ├─ Smart Match logic  ├─ Realtime subscriptions (listings, claims)
           ├─ Impact calc        ├─ Auth (JWT)
           ├─ Push notif proxy   └─ Storage (food photos)
           └─ Nominatim proxy
```

**Why Express backend instead of just Supabase Edge Functions:**
- Smart Match algorithm lives here (too complex for edge)
- Push notification batching
- Impact calculation engine
- Centralized Nominatim rate limiting
- Easy to demo as deployed URL

## User Types & Auth

**Login screen:** Single screen, two prominent toggle cards — "I'm a Donor" / "I'm an NGO". Different tints, same clean layout. Supabase Auth (email+password for MVP).

---

### Donor Onboarding (3 steps, skip-able after step 1)
1. Name + org type (Individual / Restaurant / Hotel / Caterer / Other)
2. Address → auto-geocode via Nominatim
3. What do you usually have? (chips: Cooked Meals / Raw Produce / Packaged Goods / Beverages / Bakery)

### NGO Onboarding (3 steps)
1. Org name + registration number (shown as "Pending Verification" badge until demo auto-approves)
2. Address → auto-geocode
3. Preferences: Veg / Non-Veg / Both + max capacity (kg/day slider) + pickup radius (km slider)

**Verification:** For demo, all NGOs auto-verified after 30s (simulated). In production, admin panel reviews reg number.

## Core Features

### 1. Realtime Listing Feed
Supabase Realtime subscriptions on `listings` table. NGOs within radius receive instant in-app notification when new food is listed. No polling, no delay.

---

### 2. Smart Match Engine (Innovation ⭐)
Express backend endpoint: `POST /api/match`
When a donor lists food, the engine scores every verified NGO in the DB:

```
Score = (1/distance_km × 0.4) + (preference_match × 0.3) + (capacity_headroom × 0.2) + (urgency_bonus × 0.1)
```

Returns top 3 suggested NGOs. Donor sees "Suggested for you" NGO cards on listing confirmation.
This is the innovation angle — no other food rescue app does intelligent matching, they all use simple proximity.

---

### 3. Scheduling System
- Donor sets pickup window (e.g., 2 PM – 6 PM)
- NGO picks a specific time within that window
- Conflict detection: NGO can't claim overlapping pickup times
- Both parties get push notification at T-1h before pickup
- Schedule stored in `claims` table, surfaced in both apps' Schedule screens

---

### 4. QR Pickup Verification (Innovation ⭐)
- On a confirmed claim, donor's app generates a unique QR code (encoded: claim_id + token)
- At pickup, NGO scans QR via `expo-barcode-scanner`
- Express API validates token → marks claim as `completed`
- Both sides see "Verified" status — builds trust, prevents fraud
- This creates a closed loop: List → Claim → Schedule → Verify → Impact logged

---

### 5. FoodPrint™ Impact Score (Innovation ⭐)
Proprietary metric calculated on the backend. Formula:

```
CO₂ saved (kg)   = kg_rescued × 2.5
Water saved (L)  = kg_rescued × 1000
Meals enabled    = kg_rescued × 3
People reached   = meals_enabled / 3
```

Shown on both dashboards with animated counters. Shareable card generated as an image.
Judges love a concrete metric — this makes impact tangible and memorable.

---

### 6. Push Notifications (Expo Push API)
Triggered from Express backend:
- NGO: "New donation near you — 15kg cooked meal, expires in 2h" 
- Donor: "Your donation was claimed by [NGO name]"
- Both: "Pickup in 1 hour — [food name] at [time]"
- Donor: "Pickup confirmed! Your food reached someone in need 🌱"

---

### 7. Partial Quantity Claiming
An NGO can claim 10 of 30 kg. `qty_remaining` decrements on `listings`. Remaining qty stays `available` for other NGOs. Prevents waste of the listing itself.

---

**Supabase RLS Policies:**
- Users can only read/write their own profile
- Listings: donors own theirs; NGOs can read `available` listings within radius
- Claims: NGOs own theirs; donors can read claims on their listings
- Realtime enabled on `listings` (for NGO feed), `claims` (for donor updates)

**P2 (if time allows):** Push notifications + shareable card + badge system

## Pitch Angle

**Hook (10 seconds):** "Every day, enough food is wasted to feed every hungry person on the planet — twice. The food exists. The people exist. What's missing is the loop."

**Problem:** 1/3 of food produced globally = wasted. 828M people face food insecurity. Existing solutions are call-based, slow, and informal. No closed loop. No accountability.

**Solution:** FoodLoop — a real-time mobile platform where surplus food is listed in under 60 seconds, intelligently matched to verified NGOs, scheduled for pickup, and verified on collection. Every step logged. Every meal counted.

**Live Demo Flow:**
1. Donor lists 20kg biryani, sets 3–7 PM window → Smart Match suggests 2 NGOs
2. NGO sees live notification, claims 15kg, picks 4 PM
3. Donor sees "Claimed" status, generates QR
4. NGO scans QR at pickup → both see "Verified ✓"
5. FoodPrint™ updates: +15kg rescued, +37.5kg CO₂ saved, +45 meals enabled

**Innovation (for judges):** Three things no other app does: (1) Smart Match scoring engine, (2) QR-based closed-loop verification, (3) FoodPrint™ environmental impact metric. These aren't features — they're the architecture of trust.

**Scalability Story:** Every city has restaurants closing with unsold food and NGOs unable to find it. FoodLoop is city-agnostic infrastructure. Deploy in Mumbai today, Nairobi tomorrow.

**Closing line:** "FoodLoop doesn't solve hunger. But it dissolves the invisible wall between a restaurant's surplus and a family's empty plate. Code against collapse — one loop at a time."
